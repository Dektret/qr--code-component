## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me to learn how to center a container as well as mobile-first and desktop-first methods. I got an idea on how to center a container on a blank page and what steps need to be followed in order to write inside a container.

```css
.container {
    display: block;

    background-color: #fff;
    text-align: center;
    max-width: 100%;
    padding: 15px;
    border-radius: 15px;

    box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.07);
}
```

### Continued development

Currently, I am a beginner in frontend web development. I started learning html and css just to develop additional skills. Now, that i have experienced desinging webpages and also knowing the fact that there is more to web designing than just html and css i started to have fun messing with webpages. I found myself consuming more and more content of web development over the internet and even though i understood nothing it was fun to watch and see people creating webpages out of nothing but just code. I am on a journey to learn frontend web development and then to become a full stack developer soon! 

### Useful resources

- (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFyMWwOxHYM) - This helped me for when i was stuck on how i could center the container on both the horizontal and vertical axis. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/comparison-between-css-grid-css-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand when grid and flex comes to use. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
